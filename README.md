# llmBased_vulnPrediction
Prediction of vulnerable software components by fine-tuning Transformer-based pre-trained Large Language Models.

### Replication Package of our research work entitled "Vulnerability prediction using pre-trained models: An empirical evaluation"

To replicate the analysis and reproduce the results:

~~~
git clone https://github.com/iliaskaloup/llmBased_vulnPrediction.git
~~~
and navigate to the cloned repository.

The "data" directory contains the data required for training and evaluating the models.

The dataset.csv file in the repository is the pre-processed "sequences of tokens" format of the dataset.

The py_corpus.txt file contains the python corpus utilized to train the word2vec embedding vectors. You need to unzip the py_corpus.zip first.

The jupyter notebook files (.ipynb) in the "ml" folder are python files, which perform the whole analysis. Specifically:

• pytorch/ptBert performs fine-tuning of the BERT and CodeBERT models to the downstream task of vulnerability prediction

• pytorch/ptGpt performs fine-tuning of the GPT-2 and CodeGPT-2 models to the downstream task of vulnerability prediction

• pytorch/ptT5 performs fine-tuning of the T5 and CodeT5 models to the downstream task of vulnerability prediction

• bow/bow_simple trains ML models based on the Bag of Words representation format

• bow/bow_tf_idf trains ML models based on the term frequency–inverse document frequency (tf-idf) representation format

• gensim/train_embeddings trains custom word embedding vectors using word2vec

• gensim/embs_to_dl trains an LSTM model on the word2vec encoded sequences of tokens
